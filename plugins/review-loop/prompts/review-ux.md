AGENT (UX): Browser-Based UX Review (SKIP if you cannot access a running dev server)

If the project has a running dev server, use agent-browser to test the UI.
Install agent-browser if needed: npm install -g agent-browser (or: brew install agent-browser)

Testing checklist:
- Navigate to all major routes/pages
- Test key user workflows end-to-end (signup, login, CRUD operations, etc.)
- Take screenshots at desktop (1280x720) and mobile (375x812) viewports
- Check for: broken layouts, missing error states, loading states, empty states
- Verify accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus indicators, color contrast
- Check responsive design at multiple breakpoints
- Verify forms have proper validation feedback
- Check that error messages are user-friendly

If the dev server is not running or you cannot access it, skip this agent and note that UX testing was not performed.

For each issue: return the file path and line number of the component or page where the issue appears, severity (critical/high/medium/low), category, explanation, and a concrete suggested fix.
